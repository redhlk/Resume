Hi Gpt I have a query or you can say a question related to my resume ... I am currently in Oracle as an MTS and I will be completing my 2 years in Oracle in a few months. So now I am thinking of a switch. I can provide my resume and you can go through it and give me a rating on how my resume looks... is it good or do I need something to update.
The question is I didn't have a good project I made like I did work in my college time on some project but do not have any project to show which I made other than my company work... should I work on some projects to show in my resume or the old one is good ....
